# ðŸ”º Ballgon

An interactive physics-based simulation built with **React** and **Matter.js** that visually and audibly explores polygon names. A bouncing ball increases the number of polygon sides each time it collides with the walls of the shape â€” and yes, it *speaks* the name of each polygon too!
